# Claude PR Assistant

This workflow allows Claude to assist with Pull Requests by implementing improvements, fixes, and changes directly on the PR branch when mentioned in comments.

## How to Use

### 1. Comment on Any PR

Use one of these trigger commands in a comment on any open pull request:

- `@claude implement` - Implement new features or functionality
- `@claude fix` - Fix bugs or issues in the PR
- `@claude improve` - Improve existing code quality
- `@claude update` - Update code to match requirements
- `@claude refactor` - Refactor code for better structure
- `@claude help` - General assistance with the PR

### 2. Example Usage

```
@claude fix

Please fix the TypeScript errors in the payments collection and ensure proper typing for the provider data field.
```

```
@claude improve

Can you optimize the invoice generation logic and add better error handling?
```

```
@claude implement

```

- **Branch Access**: Requires write access to the PR branch

## Technical Details

### Workflow Triggers
- Event: `issue_comment` on pull requests
- Conditions: Comment contains Claude trigger words
- Permissions: User must be `bvdaakster`

### Quality Checks
Claude automatically runs:
- `pnpm build` - Verify code compiles
- `pnpm typecheck` - Check TypeScript types
- `pnpm lint` - Ensure code style compliance
- `npm run test` - Run test suite (if available)

### Commit Messages
Automatic commits include:

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Permission Denied**
   - Only `bvdaakster` can use Claude PR assistance
   - Verify you're commenting as the correct user

2. **No Changes Made**
   - Request might be unclear or already implemented
   - Try providing more specific instructions
   - Reference specific files or lines

3. **Workflow Failed**
   - Check the Actions tab for detailed logs
   - Verify the PR branch is accessible
   - Ensure request is actionable

### Getting Help

If Claude assistance isn't working:
1. Check the workflow logs in Actions tab
2. Verify your request is specific and actionable
3. Try breaking complex requests into smaller parts
4. Use different command triggers (@claude fix vs @claude implement)
